About me
------

I am a second-year master student at Tsinghua University. My research mainly lies in **LLMs**, **Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL)**, and **Information Retrieval (IR)**, with a recent emphasis on **Web Agents**.

A core motivation of my work is to use **interaction with real environments** to **improve the base competence of models**, such as their planning ability, robustness, and generalization.

Research Interests
------

My current and past research topics include:

- **LLMs & Agentic Reinforcement Learning**  
  - Building **web agents** that autonomously browse, understand, and operate complex websites to complete long-horizon tasks.  
  - Using web interaction as a **training ground to enhance the fundamental capabilities** of models, such as:
    - strategic planning and task decomposition,  
    - tool use and API interaction,  
    - handling noisy, dynamic, and partially observable environments.  
  - Integrating **RL with LLMs** so that agents can learn from **trial-and-error** in realistic tasks, instead of relying only on offline supervised data.  
  - Studying how agentic interaction can feed back into **better pretrained/backbone models** (e.g., via behavior data, trajectories, and preferences).

- **Information Retrieval**  
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
    - Designing retrieval and reranking pipelines to support LLMs with accurate and up-to-date external knowledge.  
    - Analyzing how retrieval quality and system design affect downstream reasoning and generation robustness.  
  - **Recommender Systems (Recsys)**  
    - Exploring retrieval and ranking methods in recommender systems, especially under sparse signals or long-term user feedback.  
    - Studying how interaction data and user behavior can be exploited to improve both **retrieval** and **personalized recommendation**.  
  - More broadly, I am interested in **neural retrieval**, **learning to rank**, and **evaluation** for IR and recommendation, especially when combined with agentic LLMs.

I am broadly interested in the intersection of **RL, LLM-based agents, and IR**, and in how **real-world interaction** can be leveraged to build more capable and reliable foundation models.
